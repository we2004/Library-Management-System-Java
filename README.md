# Library-Management-System-Java
A simple Java-based console application that allows users to manage a library. Users can add fiction and non-fiction books, search for books, display all books, and remove books. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, method overriding, and the use of ArrayLists.
